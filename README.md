# BMI CALCULATOR: A sololearn project
This is a simple Python program that calculates a person's body mass index (BMI) based on their weight and height. The program takes in user input for weight and height, and then outputs the corresponding BMI category.

## How to Use
To use the BMI calculator, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open a terminal window and navigate to the project directory.
3. Run the program using the command python bmi_calculator.py.
4. Enter your weight and height when prompted.
5. The program will output your BMI category.

## BMI Categories
The program uses the following categories to determine a person's BMI:

* Underweight: BMI less than 18.5
* Normal: BMI between 18.5 and 24.9
* Overweight: BMI between 25 and 29.9
* Obesity: BMI 30 or greater
